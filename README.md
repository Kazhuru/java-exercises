# Programming Exercises 

In this repository I propose a set of exercises to work some design patterns, OOD and specific tools 
of the language used.

1. [Polymorphism, design patterns and databases](exercise1.md)
1. [Multiple dynamic datasources](exercise2.md)


If you want to work on them please fork my repo so it can be tracked and others can see your solution.

If you'd like some mentoring feel free to add me as reviewer to you own PRs and I'll be happy to 
add feedback if I get the time.
